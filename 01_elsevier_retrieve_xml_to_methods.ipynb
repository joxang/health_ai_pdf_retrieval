Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased mortality in infected patients, especially when it newly presents during hospitalization for COVID-19.

Logistic regression was used to predict the outcome. The models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), history of hypertension, history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and presence of an intracardiac device. Four metrics extracted from ECGs were also included: ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval. ECG metrics were treated as continuous variables. Race categories were Asian, Black, White Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, and Other/Unknown. BMI was either entered by clinical staff or calculated from height and weight. Age and BMI were treated as continuous variables. History of hypertension, history of CAD, and presence of intracardiac device were treated as binary variables, with the reference being not present. The reference category for sex assigned at birth was male. Race/ethnicity was included as a factor, with non-Hispanic White as the reference. The logistic regression models used the same optimal threshold identification process as outlined above for the AI models in the test set and performance metrics were evaluated in the validation cohort. Results of the model performances from all different train/validation/test iterations carried out as part of the 10-fold cross-validation process were aggregated to determine 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were performed using the R programming language, version 3.6.1, and used packages readxl, tidyr, dplyr, caret, and pROC.\\n                     ',\n",

In each case, we considered 128 unique network permutations and carried out a complete set of train/test cycles using our 10-fold cross-validation schemes (ie, 1280 unique runs per model), meaning that the predictive capabilities of the models shown in , ,  are the best possible outcome for this set of DNN parameters. As such, we are confident that the modest AUROC values for our 2 models are not the consequence of an inadequate exploration of what DNN technology might potentially offer.',\n",

       " 'The imperfect performance of our network demonstrates an important aspect of ML applications: explainability. While many DNN architectures allow for identification of specific features predictive of adverse outcomes, we were unable to do so because of the LSTM components included in our DNNs. The CNN models in our study were trained to identify adverse outcomes regardless of the exact changes occurring on the ECG. We believe it is entirely possible that the CNNs could be using any changes encoded in that signal (eg, heart rate, heart rate variability, QRS width, ST changes, or combinations of these elements) to make predictions about outcomes. In the case of COVID-19, it is possible that the most salient ECG markers are those that are indicative of baseline comorbidity, such as right atrial abnormality or right ventricular strain pattern, which suggest pulmonary disease. Alternatively, the network may have preferentially identified novel features associated with severe COVID-19 disease. To examine exactly what features the CNN models are examining to make these predictions, we would have to use certain explainable AI models, which would be more interpretable. This was beyond the scope of the current project, but future studies may be able to harness new computational techniques to improve approaches in this regard. It is also difficult to speculate what steps may be taken to improve model performance. We hypothesize that the heterogeneity of both the components of MACE and varied causes of mortality contributed to poor performance. Future efforts may benefit from identification of more narrowly defined outcomes with linear and biologically plausible mechanistic connections between cardiac electrical activity and the outcome.',\n",

In the context of the current study, it is noteworthy that at least 1 ECG feature (ventricular rate) was strongly associated with both death and MACE. While it is possible that formulation of alternative statistical models using exclusively ECG metrics, demographic data, or comorbidity information might elucidate the key drivers of predictive capability, these analyses were deemed beyond the scope of this AI-focused study. Nevertheless, the fact that the predictive accuracy of both conventional models outstripped that of our AI-based methods suggests that future development of mixed-input CNN-LSTMs that analyze both raw ECG and demographic/comorbidity data might prove useful.',\n",

Although the accuracy we observed was not superior to the traditional model based on clinical data, we note that triage tools for potentially fatal diseases should prioritize high NPV and our models did achieve that design goal. A deep learning model based on both clinical and ECG data might be able to achieve better accuracy; however, building such a network with heterogeneous inputs is complicated and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been attempted in this field.
